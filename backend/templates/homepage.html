    <h1>Welcome to SteamSpire!</h1>
    <p>
        In this Victorian-era Steampunk city-builder game, your goal is to create the largest and most profitable city within a set time limit.
        Build a thriving city by strategically managing your zones and resources. Aim for the highest score possible based on your cityâ€™s performance.
    </p>
    <p>Zone Types:</p>
        <li>Industrial Zones: Increase your steam count.</li>
        <li>Commercial Zones: Boost your gear count. More citizens lead to more gears produced.</li>
        <li>Residential Zones: Grow your population.</li>
    <p>Resource Management:</p>
        <li>For every 10 citizens, you consume 1 steam daily.</li>
        <li>Use gears to purchase additional land and unlock new zones.</li>
    <!-- <p>Military Zones:</p>
        <li>Invest in military zones to enhance your military standing without consuming steam. Each zone costs 10 gears.</li>
        <li>You can attempt to invade plots of land for free based on your military standing, but failing this incurs a loss of 1 military standing and a random military zone.</li> -->
