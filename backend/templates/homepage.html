    <p>Welcome to SteamSpire, a city-builder game where you manage a Victorian-era Steampunk city.
    Build industrial zones to increase your steam count, build commercial zones to increase your gear count,
    and build residential zones to increase your population!
    The more citizens you have, the more gears you make with each commercial zone. Use your gears to buy more land.
    Remember, for every 10 citizens you have, 1 steam will be used each day!
    You will need a certain amount of citizens to unlock new zones.
    If you're feeling risky, you can invest in military zones, adding to your military standing. 
    They will not take up steam, but will take up 10 gears per zone. 
    Depending on your military standing, you have a set chance of claiming a plot of land for free if you choose to invade instead of purchase. 
    Keep in mind that if you fail the chance, you will lose 1 military standing and a random military zone. 
    The goal is to build the biggest and most profitable city you can in a time limit of your choosing. You will receive a grade at the end. Good luck!</p>
