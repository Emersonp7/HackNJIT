Say, young fellow? You think yourself a fine entrepeneur?
You think Rome wasn't built in a day because they didn't have gears and steam?!
Well, it's high-time you spin your gears and show your mettle in SteamSpire!

SteamSpire is a Victorian-era, Steampunk-styled city builder game, where your
goal is to create the largest, most profitable city within a few days.
Build a thriving city by strategically managing your zones and resources.

Before starting thyhe game, choose how many days you want to take to build, from 1-30 days.

- Gears - The finest currency for a steampunk world! You can use yours to buy land and make different zones.
- Steam - This powers all the steam inventions around! This gets produced by your Industrial Zones.
- Citizens - The good people of SteamSpire who spend gears and use steam to get around. Every day, 10 citizens consume 1 steam.


The game features 9 zones you can purchase and turn into different zone types, like:
- Industrial Zones - Time to build up your steam power! Industrial zones give you 5 steam per day.
- Commercial Zones - Fine bronze for sale! Commercial zones give you gears, with more citizens giving you more gears.
- Residential Zones - Only the best lodgings for the modern steam enthusiast! Residential zones get you more citizens.
