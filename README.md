## Welcome to SteamSpire
Say, young fellow? You think yourself a fine entrepeneur?
You think Rome wasn't built in a day because they didn't have gears and steam?!
Well, it's high-time you spin your gears and show your mettle in SteamSpire!

SteamSpire is a Victorian-era, Steampunk-styled city builder game, where your
goal is to create the largest, most profitable city within 7 days.
Build a thriving city by strategically managing your zones and resources.

Resources include:
- Gears - The finest currency for a steampunk world! You can use yours to buy land and make different zones.
- Steam - This powers all the steam inventions around! This gets produced by your Industrial Zones.
- Citizens - The good people of SteamSpire who spend gears and use steam to get around.

The game features 9 zones you can purchase and turn into different zone types, like:
- Industrial Zones - Time to build up your steam power! Industrial zones give you 5 steam per day.
- Commercial Zones - Fine bronze for sale! For every commercial zone you build, you receive 25 gears per day.
- Residential Zones - Only the best lodgings for the modern steam enthusiast! Residential zones get you 5 citizens.

Aim for the highest score possible based on your cityâ€™s performance at the end of your days!
Swell luck, steampunk!
